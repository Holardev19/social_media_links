## My process
1. I studied the project design closely.
2. I went through the docs that came with it especially instructions.
3. I designed in my head, making a mental note of the html markup, syntax and css style tools.
4. I wrote the html markup.
5. I went ahead to style it in my css.
6. Made some changes in my html.
7. Then finished up the design in my css.
8. And then added mobile responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow


### What I learned


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   transition: color 500ms ease;
}
```


### Continued development
